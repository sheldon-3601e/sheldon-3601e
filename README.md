### Hi there, I'm Sheldon! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a university student majoring in backend development, with a strong focus on Java. Currently, I'm expanding my skills by learning Python and delving into frontend development. I'm comfortable working with both React and Vue frameworks to develop simple web pages.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python to broaden my programming language repertoire.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to backend development in Java, or my experiences learning Python and frontend development!

Let's connect and learn together! ðŸ˜„
